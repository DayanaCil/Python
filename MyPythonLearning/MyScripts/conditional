Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit. Go to the editor
[ Formula : c/5 = f-32/9 [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ]
Ask the user to input the value with NumberF or NumberC
F=(X*1.8)+32
C=(X-32)*.55

Hints:
Use string slicing
Use format typing
if else block to tell us if they are in cold or hot or balanced climate place
